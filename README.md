## Overview
This project aims to improve road safety by using IoT devices installed in vehicles and on highways. The system detects vehicles running ahead of a particular vehicle using industrial-grade ultrasonic sensors. It triggers alarms for the driver using lights installed on the dashboard in foggy weather when visibility is low. Additionally, if a vehicle suffers an accident, it transmits a signal to nearby receiver modules installed on light poles along the highway, triggering warning lights and sounds to alert other drivers.

## Components
- Transmitter Module: Installed in vehicles, it includes an ultrasonic sensor and LoRa module for communication.
- Receiver Module: Installed on light poles, it includes a LoRa module for communication and warning lights/sounds.

## Features
- Ultrasonic sensor detects vehicles ahead and triggers alarms.
- LoRa communication for long-range connectivity between transmitter and receiver modules.
- Automatic warning system for accidents.
- Scalable for use on highways with multiple transmitter and receiver modules.

## Setup
1. Install the transmitter module in the vehicle and the receiver module on the light poles along the highway.
2. Ensure proper power supply and connectivity for all modules.
3. Configure the LoRa modules with the correct frequencies and settings for communication.
4. Calibrate the ultrasonic sensors for accurate distance measurements.

## Usage
- The system operates automatically once installed and configured.
- Drivers will be alerted by dashboard lights in the event of vehicles too close ahead.
- Warning lights and sounds on light poles will alert drivers in the event of an accident.
